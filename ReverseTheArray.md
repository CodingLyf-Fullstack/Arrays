**Two Pointers:** Use two pointers, left starting at the beginning of the array and right starting at the end.

**Swap:** Swap the elements at the left and right pointers.

**Move Pointers:** Increment left and decrement right until they meet or cross.

**In-Place Operation:** This approach does not require additional memory since the swapping happens within the array.
